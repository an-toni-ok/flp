# What am I trying to do?

Create a drawing area in which:
- rectangles can be drawn by clicking into the area and dragging
- rectangles size can be changed by holding a click on a rectangles border and moving the mouse.
- rectangles can be deleted
- rectangles have a label with their width and height displayed
- rectangles width and height snap to certain limits (e.g. every x pixels denoting a real world distance of 0.1m)
